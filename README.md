texturestack
============
Widget for superimposing several textures one on top of the other, such that they move like they are a single texture. 

Good for constructing virtual paper dolls, such as those used to represent the player character in eg. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.

Includes two classes: TextureStack proper requires a list of kivy Texture objects; ImageStack is happy with a list of paths to loadable images.
